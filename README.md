# React Dice Game

Welcome to the React Dice Game project! In this repository, I've developed an engaging dice game with rules. It allows you to select a number and test your luck by rolling the dice. Below, I'll provide you with an overview of the project.

## Game Rules

1. **Select a Number:** Start by selecting any number you think the dice will show.

2. **Roll the Dice:** Click on the dice image to roll it and reveal the number it lands on.

3. **Guess and Win:** If the number you selected matches the one on the dice, you earn the same number of points as the dice. 

4. **Wrong Guess:** If your guess is incorrect, 2 points will be deducted from your score.

## Features

- A dynamic and interactive game built using React, where you can guess the dice number.
- Utilizes Styled Components for flexible and maintainable styling.
- Implements React's useState to manage the game's state, including score tracking.
- Features multiple pages to enhance the user experience, including game rules.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Here, you'll find JavaScript files that define the various game components, manage the state, and implement game logic.
- `styles/`: This directory contains styled-components to style the game elements.
- `public/`: May contain any static assets like images or additional resources.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Styled Components)
